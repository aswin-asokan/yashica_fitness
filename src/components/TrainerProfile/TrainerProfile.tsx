        <p>I started lifting when I was 16 and now I’m 27.</p>
        <p>That’s 11 years of experience living this lifestyle.</p>
        <p>
          In 2014 I began working online and have now helped over <strong>10,000+</strong> men and women change their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of experience, one thing I can tell you is each person is unique, what works for others, might not work for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most programs are one size fits all, and the reality is we are <strong>ALL</strong> different. We need tailored routines specific to us and our needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I design your program, I craft it precise, enjoyable and tailored to you, your goals, likes and dislikes and fitness orientation which means you’re guaranteed to get results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I give you all the tools you need to optimise your health & body composition towards long term results and an education on how to do things the right way from here on out.
        </p>
        <p>No more quick fixes, no more gimmicks, no more frustration, just results.</p>
