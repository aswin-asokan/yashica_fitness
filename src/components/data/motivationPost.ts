That initial burst of enthusiasm can feel exhilarating, but as the weeks turn into months, and the novelty wears off, it's easy for that spark to dim. We've all been there, hitting a plateau, facing unexpected setbacks, or simply losing the desire to lace up our shoes.",

Life happens: stress, fatigue, illness, or even just boredom can derail your best intentions. Instead of beating yourself up when motivation dips, understand that it's a natural part of the process. The key is to have strategies in place to navigate these dips and prevent them from becoming outright stops.",
